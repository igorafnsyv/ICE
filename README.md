Make sure you have initialized git repository on your computer. It is initialized in the same folder where you can find README file, ICE folder and other stuff. Make sure you initialized it in the correct directory. If you clone the repository from GitHub, .git hidden repository should be already there. 

Working with git:

1. When you start working, update your project directory to the most recent version of our master branch by calling this command:

Note: origin is the name of remote repository

git pull origin master

2. To make your changes available on GitHub:

	a. git checkout test
	
		a1. if it shows some error, try creating new branch by doing this
		
			git branch test 
	b. git add -A
	
	c. git commit -m "Insert you message here. Form of message: [Verb] [Changes Made]"
	
	d. git push -u origin test

3. Check GitHub. Changes will not appear on Master Branch yet. 
   You need to create a Pull Request. Can be done on GitHub

4. Just follow the Pull Request instructions. BUT NEVER. NEVER PRESS MERGE.
   I will review your code myself and approve changes
